## gog-games.to games backup

Since gog-games.to will be going private on March 23,\
I backed up the site's game resources.

**Total 5141 entries as of 2024/3/23.**

Each json file represents a game resource,\
All fields in it are returned directly by gog-games.\
Except the href, which is the link to the game resource.
```text
https://gog-games.to + href
```

## Script usage
```
generate_site.py json_files_folder
```
